# Signalbroker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server)

Development tool to read and write CAN/LIN and other buses using gRPC which allows usage of preferred language.

Sample scenarios:
* [5Gcar](https://5gcar.eu/) where it's used to gather realtime data from Volvo vehicles.

## Get started

To get you started all you need to do is:
- Open a terminal/console window.
- Clone this repo: 
    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:volvo-cars/signalbroker-server.git
    ```
- Move to the new folder: 
    ```shell
    $ cd signalbroker-server
    ```
- Use docker-compose "up" for linux: 
  ```shell
  docker-compose up
  ```
- and for OSX: 
  ```shell
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.macos.yml up
  ```

That's it! Signal Broker will be running after the first build.

For more information about:
- docker-compose follow this [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- Other ways to start the server [read this](https://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server#starting-the-server-for-docker-skip-down).
- how to configure the server [read this](https://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server#configuring-the-server)

## Hardware

The software can execute on any Linux with [SocketCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SocketCAN). On hosts without hardware CAN interfaces, virtual CAN be configured using:
```
sudo modprobe vcan
sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
sudo ifconfig vcan0 up
```

System is configured using [interfaces.json](configuration/interfaces.json)

Extensive reference can be found here [link](configuration/interfaces_referense.json)

## Real deal

In order to access real CAN the following hardware can be used.

Suggested hardware
- Raspberry PI.
- Raspberry PI CAN shield [get it here for US](https://copperhilltech.com/pican2-duo-can-bus-board-for-raspberry-pi-2-3/) or [here for Europe](http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican2-duo-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-23-with-smps-p-1481.html).
- [lin DYI](https://github.com/AleksandarFilipov/signalbroker-lin-transceiver)

Works is ongoing for CAN-FD support which is in experimental stage.
- Raspberry PI CAN-FD shield [get it here for US](https://copperhilltech.com/pican-fd-can-bus-fd-duo-board-with-real-time-clock-for-raspberry-pi/) or [here for Europe](http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican-fd-duo-board-with-real-time-clock-for-raspberry-pi-3-p-1568.html)

## Accessing the server
Signalbroker is headless but can be accessed using the grpc-web [frontend](https://github.com/AleksandarFilipov/signalbroker-web-client)

To get aquainted to the system the easiest way to get going is by checking out the simple [telnet guide](apps/app_telnet/README.md)

However, the preferred way of accessing the system is by using grpc. Follow this [link](/apps/grpc_service/proto_files) to find the protofiles, and browse the [examples](/examples/grpc) to get inspiration

### Additional access possibilities
* c code. If you like to use c code [go here](/apps/app_unixds/README.md)
* websockets, make it play with node [red](https://nodered.org/) or similar, [go here](https://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-web-client)
* grpc_curl, https://github.com/salrashid123/grpc_curl
  
## Configuring the server
The configuration of the server can be done with `configuration/interfaces.json`. This location is the default but if you are using docker-compose you can add an `.env` file to change it. In this case the configuration folder can be place outside of the repo to avoid adding configuration files by accident. If you add this line to the `.env` file the configuration will be place outside the repository. 
```bash
CONFIG_FOLDER=../configuration/
```

## Starting the server (for docker skip down)

- [Install elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
- Clone this repository.
- Make sure your `configuration/interfaces.json` makes sense (or try out of the box).
- Start the software by doing.

```
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```

## Start with **prebuild** images using docker - **recommended**

prebuilt images are available for intel and arm

## to run with docker-compose using .env:
If you add a file named `.env` with this:
```bash
# Custom tag name
# This tag can be used for version control
TAG=v1

# This is the IP of the host PC  
# in the network interface you are using to communicate 
DOCKER_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1

# Path to the configuration folder 
# relative to the root of the signalbroker-server
CONFIG_FOLDER=../configuration/

# Custom command to use template files
CUSTOM_COMMAND=bash -c "ls /"
```
you can change the default values used by docker compose. To read more about "Variable substitution in docker-compose follow [this link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#variable-substitution)

### to run with your configuration:

- Clone this repository (to get the a valid configuration folder), then;

```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged=true --net=host -v $PWD/configuration/:/signalbroker/_build/prod/rel/signal_server/configuration aleksandarf/signalbroker-server:travis-81-amd64
```
If you are in MacOS or Windows `--net=host` is not available and you need to do the port mapping:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged=true -p 4040:4040 -p 50051:50051 -p 2000:2000/udp -p 2001:2001/udp -v $PWD/configuration/:/signalbroker/_build/prod/rel/signal_server/configuration aleksandarf/signalbroker-server:travis-81-amd64
```

### or run it with sample configuration:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged=true --net=host -p 4040:4040 -p 50051:50051 -p 2000:2000/udp -p 2001:2001/udp aleksandarf/signalbroker-server:travis-81-amd64
```

> Remember to pick your tag including architecture. this is done by replacing `travis-81-amd64` with appropriate tag [travis-81-`amd64` | travis-81-`arm64` | travis-81-`arm32`]

> Find propriate tag [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aleksandarf/signalbroker-server/tags?page=1). 

## Alternatively; start using docker
Clone this repository, then;

- Clone this repository, then;
```bash
docker build -t signalbroker:v1 -f ./docker/Dockerfile .
```


### to run with your configuration:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged=true --net=host -v $PWD/configuration/:/signalbroker/_build/prod/rel/signal_server/configuration signalbroker:v1
```
If you are in OSX or Windows `--net=host` is not available and you need to do the port mapping:
```bash
docker run -it --network="bridge" -p 127.0.0.1:4040:4040 -p 127.0.0.1:50051:50051 -p 127.0.0.1:2000:2000/udp -p 127.0.0.1:2001:2001/udp -v $PWD/configuration:/signalbroker/_build/prod/rel/signal_server/configuration signalbroker:v1
```

### or run it with sample configuration:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged=true --net=host signalbroker:v1
```
If you are in OSX or Windows `--net=host` is not available and you need to do the port mapping:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 4040:4040 -p 50051:50051 -p 2000:2000/udp -p 2001:2001/udp signalbroker:v1
```

> you should be able to do above on intel or arm32/arm64. 

## Playback for off line purposes
On your Linux computer, install the following.
```
apt-get install can-utils
```
Record can from a real network:
```
candump -L can0 > myfile.log
```
Once you configured your *interfaces.json* to use virtual CAN interfaces by setting using `vcan0` instead of `can0` just play back your recorded file:
```
canplayer vcan0=can0 -I myfile.log
```

## Running examples with fake data
Install `can-utils` as described above the generate fake data using:
```
cangen vcan0  -v -g 1
```

## Running examples with fake data without socketcan (particulary useful for mac/osx)
Interfaces contains a namespace "UDPCanInterface" this accepts data over UDP.

### A: Playback candump file (for dev environment)
```elixir
iex -S mix
FakeCanConnection.start_link(:fake_generator_1, :UDPCanInterface, "data/candump/candump.log")
```
you can start any number of generators

> the data will be correctly formated if recorded using `candump -L can0`

### B: or by sending single messages
to simulate can traffic from your host:
```bash
echo -n '00000040080102030405060708' | xxd -r -p | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 2001
```

or wrap it with `watch` to keep it repeating the command
```bash
watch -n 0 "echo -n '00000040080102030405060708' | xxd -r -p | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 2001"
```

format is id::size(32), payload_length::size(8), payload::(64)
Size is ignored if `"fixed_payload_size": 8` in `interfaces.json` file is set.

### A or B check that messages are sent through

Above command will produce a message on id 0x40 where `BenchC_a` signal resides in the default sample configuration. You can verify this by doing
```bash
telnet 127.0.0.1 4040
{"command": "subscribe", "signals": ["BenchC_d_8","BenchC_d_2","BenchC_c_5","BenchC_c_1","BenchC_c_6","BenchC_d_7","BenchC_d_1","BenchC_c_7","BenchC_a","BenchC_d_4","BenchC_c_2","BenchC_d_6","BenchC_d_5","BenchC_c_8","BenchC_d_3","BenchC_c_4","BenchC_b","BenchC_c_3"], "namespace" : "UDPCanInterface"}
```
if you now send using strategy `A` or `B` you should receive something like
```
{"timestamp":1569247543145471,"signals":{"BenchC_a":72623859790382856}}
```

## ODB diagnostics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs is a set of predifined queries which many vehicle supports. For this scenario you can start by using the predefiend [dbc](configuration/can/diagnostics.dbc). Start by running queries using the [frontend](https://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-web-client) or check out the diagnostics [sample](examples/grpc/python/simple_example.py#L62). 

## Advanced usage

- Signalbroker can be used to dispatch **arbitrary messages** between any clients by defining virtual networks. Example [here](examples/grpc/python/README.md)
- **Signal reflection** (reflector). When CAN networks share frames (in dbc files), interfaces.json can be configured to forward frames automatically. Filtering can be applied to avoid forwarding specific frames. Example configuration can be found [here](configuration/interfaces_referense.json)
- **Lin arbitration** (header) signal is exposed to the client as any signal. This allows client to Signalbroker when configured as a slave to act on arbitration. Alternatively the client can act as master thus implement a custom arbitration scheme. In the latter case the schedule_autostart should be disabled. Arbitration example is avaliable [here](examples/grpc/go#go-and-the-signal-broker)
- Don't forget to browse [examples](/examples/grpc)    

## For mac/osx developers
For dev purpose this project builds on mac with the following limations
- socket can. Since the is no kernel support for socket can dependency ng_can can is [removed](/apps/app_ngcan/mix.exs#L51).
- all can and vcan references needs to be removed
for starters use the following [interfaces.json](configuration/osx/interfaces.json)

To successfully build you need to install gcc. [Background here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19535422/os-x-10-9-gcc-links-to-clang)
```bash
brew install gcc49
export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9
iex -S mix
```
